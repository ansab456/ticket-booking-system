# ticket-booking-system
building an integrated web system that is responsive, attractive, and functional
Here's a step-by-step procedure to run and test the complete application:
1.	Install a web server (such as Apache) and a database server (such as MySQL) on your computer or web hosting platform.
2.	Create a new folder on your web server and name it "ticket_booking_system". This will be the root folder for your application.
3.	Download and extract the required files for your application (such as the HTML form, PHP scripts, and database files) into the "ticket_booking_system" folder.
4.	Create a new database in your MySQL server and name it "ticket_booking_system". You can do this using phpMyAdmin or the MySQL command line interface.
5.	Import the provided tables into the "ticket_booking_system" database. You can do this using phpMyAdmin by selecting the "Import" option and selecting the SQL file for the tables.
6.	Edit the database connection details in the PHP scripts to match your database server settings.
7.	Launch the web server and open a web browser. Navigate to the URL of the application, for example: http://localhost/ticket_booking_system/
8.	Fill out the form with the required details and submit it. The PHP script will process the form and generate a confirmation page with the ticket cost and reference number.
9.	Test the user registration system by filling out the registration form and submitting it. The PHP script will add the user details to the "users" table in the database.
10.	Test the database connectivity by executing sample queries to retrieve information from the tables. You can do this using phpMyAdmin or by creating PHP scripts that connect to the database and execute queries.
11.	Test the ticket booking system by executing sample bookings and verifying that the tickets are properly stored in the "tickets" table with unique reference numbers.
12.	Periodically backup the database to prevent data loss.
That's it! If you follow these steps, you should be able to run and test the complete application.
